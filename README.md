Text Replacement Tool

With this tool, you can replace some of the text in a file with Josh. I think this is a very funny thing to do, if not entirely useful.

Example usage:

It is assumed your text is in a file called LameText.txt in your working directory.

The sole argument is the Josh Index. It is a number 1-10. It correlates to the percentage of your text which will be replaced with "Josh". A Josh Index of 5 will result in 50% of your text replaced with Josh. We use a pseudo-random number generator, so it is not guaranteed that you will get the exact percentage, but with enough text it should be pretty close.

The script will print the altered text to the console, as well as to a file called CoolText.txt. 

Have fun with it!
